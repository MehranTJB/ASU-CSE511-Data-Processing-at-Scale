##  ASU-CSE511-Data Processing at Scale

Database systems are used to provide convenient access to disk-resident data through efficient
query processing, indexing structures, concurrency control, and recovery. This course delves into
new frameworks for processing and generating large-scale datasets with parallel and distributed
algorithms, covering the design, deployment, and use of state-of-the-art data processing systems,
which provide scalable access to data.
Specific topics covered include:
- Efficient query processing
- Indexing structures
- Distributed database design
- Parallel query execution
- Concurrency control in distributed parallel database systems
- Data management in cloud computing environments
- Data management in Map/Reduce-based
- NoSQL database systems

Learners completing this course will be able to:
-Differentiate among major data models such as relational, spatial, and NoSQL
- Perform queries (e.g., SQL) and analytics tasks in state-of-the-art database systems
- Apply leading-edge techniques to design/tune distributed and parallel database systems
- Utilize existing NoSQL database systems as appropriate for specified cases
- Perform database operations (e.g., selection, projection, join, and group by) in state-of-the-art
cluster computing systems such as Hadoop/Spark
- Perform scalable data processing operations (e.g., selection, projection, join, and group by) in
cloud computing environments, including Amazon AWS
