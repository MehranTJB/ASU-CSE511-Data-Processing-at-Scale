## Project-2 Hot-Spot-Analysis

I implemented numerous spatial queries on a huge database that contains geographic information and the real-time locations of the customers of a well-known taxi company.

Tasks: 
- Set up Apache Spark and use dataframes within it to manage data operations.
- Write some simple Scala code then identify how to run it.
- Interact with geospatial data and run queries on it.
